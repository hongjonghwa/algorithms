If the distance is Euclidean, this problem is classical and well-known.
If the main node does not need to belong to the random nodes, then it is the "spatial median" of the points, which is solved by Weiszfeld's algorithm.
If the main node needs to belong to the random nodes, then the main node is called "central feature" (in GIS terminology). It can be obtained by simply using clustering and triangle inequality to give an upper bound of the minimum sum of distances repeatedly to eliminate the impossible candidates.
